The love and protection from your parents made us believe that you would be forever happy.",'Hearing that you have gone to another world, my heart feels unbearably heavy. Words cannot express how much I miss you. I can still hear you calling, "Sister—sister, hello—"',"You were always generous and kind-hearted, loved to care for others, and even acted playfully with your parents. Every time we saw your lively presence, all our work fatigue would disappear.","How I wish I could sit beside you again, shoulder to shoulder, and chat. But perhaps this is God’s arrangement—to let you go to paradise and accompany those who need you there.","I will forever miss your smile, your face, your Chinese, and the countless times you sincerely cared for others without exhaustion.","I pray that this abundance of energy will be passed on to more sincere hearts, more families who serve others, and more lives sustained by love.","Samuel, you have left, but your love remains. You have shown us the essence of unconditional love and have planted seeds of kindness in this world.","We will carry on, strengthened by your love, and your smile, laughter, and presence will always remain in our hearts.","With love,","Sister Ana"],t={author:e,description:o,text:a};export{e as author,t as default,o as description,a as text};
