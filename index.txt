Please give Samuel baby a kiss on my behalf and NiuNiu's, and thank him for all the beautiful feelings and memories of being needed and cherished that he has given us.","For Samuel's sake, please take good care of yourselves and accept this peacefully.","Perhaps this is God's will—to allow him to receive more love in heaven while giving you the opportunity to care more for yourselves and bring blessings to others.","Mingli may find this even harder to accept. Please take care of yourself and also look after Mingli and the children.","I told NiuNiu, and she murmured, \"How could this be?\" We held each other and cried, unable to put into words the deep grief we felt.","For those of us who were sincerely loved, warmly embraced, and deeply missed by him, this truly feels like the sky has collapsed.","It is unimaginable—what meaning does New York have without Samuel? It turns out that all the worldly prosperity is empty; only sincere love and deep care are real.","Samuel's loveliness lay in his ability to love others and himself from the bottom of his heart. He expressed himself fully—his \"up-down\" was from his childhood joy of riding elevators up and down endlessly, each time bringing him infinite satisfaction. He found joy in simply being with family—any outing was enjoyable as long as he was with his loved ones. His curiosity and focus were always on people, rather than food or scenery. His deep attachment to his parents filled his heart and eyes, leaving no space for anything else, making every other parent envy his own.","Because of him, I now understand that some people do not comfort themselves out of necessity or accept things reluctantly, but rather, they are genuinely grateful—grateful that this special child chose them as parents, giving them the opportunity to dedicate themselves and test the boundless depths of their love and abilities. And it was precisely this steadfast commitment that brought about his constant reflection of love—unwavering loyalty and infinite attachment. In reality, it was always Samuel protecting us, bringing us spiritual enlightenment and warmth.","What he gave us far exceeded what we gave him, and it will continue to warm us and inspire us to bring loyalty and devotion to this world.","Suddenly, I realize that in this era of material abundance and spiritual complexity, Samuel was like a beam of light, guiding us to focus on loving our parents, loving the world, and loving humanity. Purity is the most precious quality—it brings peace, luck, progress, self-settlement, closeness to nature, and moral elevation. It truly is the source of happiness."]},"thumbnailSrc":"/thumbnails//samchenliveson.org/text/wenyan_yang_en.json"},{"type":"image","path":"/samchenliveson.org/images/IMG_4285.jpeg","thumbnailSrc":"/thumbnails//samchenliveson.org/images/IMG_4285.jpeg"},{"type":"image","path":"/samchenliveson.org/images/IMG_3091.jpeg","thumbnailSrc":"/thumbnails//samchenliveson.org/images/IMG_3091.jpeg"},{"type":"image","path":"/samchenliveson.org/images/IMG_5380.jpeg","thumbnailSrc":"/thumbnails//samchenliveson.org/images/IMG_5380.jpeg"},{"type":"image","path":"/samchenliveson.org/images/IMG_6015.jpeg","thumbnailSrc":"/thumbnails//samchenliveson.org/images/IMG_6015.jpeg"},{"type":"image","path":"/samchenliveson.org/images/IMG_5405.jpeg","thumbnailSrc":"/thumbnails//samchenliveson.org/images/IMG_5405.jpeg"},{"type":"image","path":"/samchenliveson.org/images/IMG_5627.jpeg","thumbnailSrc":"/thumbnails//samchenliveson.org/images/IMG_5627.jpeg"},{"type":"video","path":"/samchenliveson.org/videos/IMG_0159.mov","thumbnailSrc":"/thumbnails//samchenliveson.org/videos/IMG_0159.mov"},{"type":"video","path":"/samchenliveson.org/videos/IMG_0634.mov","thumbnailSrc":"/thumbnails//samchenliveson.org/videos/IMG_0634.mov"},{"type":"text","path":"/samchenliveson.org/text/marc_ch.json","content":{"author":"Marc","description":"Brother from church","text":["早晨看到消息，想了一天依然没有找到适合的话来劝慰你们，我知道一个节哀是无力的，Samuel是幸运的，有你们这样的父母，又经常沐浴在主的光里，每一次听赞美歌都能听到他那大力的掌声，每一次夸赞别人都是那么的诚恳，我也被他夸过的，主是慈悲的，带走Samuel是有主的作用的，在那个主耶和华应许的地方，在主耶稣为我们预备好的地方，终有一天我们都再次听到他那热烈的掌声！愿主的慈爱保守他的所有！阿们"]},"thumbnailSrc":"/thumbnails//samchenliveson.org/text/marc_ch.json"},{"type":"image","path":"/samchenliveson.org/images/IMG_4727.jpeg","thumbnailSrc":"/thumbnails//samchenliveson.org/images/IMG_4727.jpeg"},{"type":"image","path":"/samchenliveson.org/images/IMG_5269.jpeg","thumbnailSrc":"/thumbnails//samchenliveson.org/images/IMG_5269.jpeg"},{"type":"image","path":"/samchenliveson.org/images/IMG_5447.jpeg","thumbnailSrc":"/thumbnails//samchenliveson.org/images/IMG_5447.jpeg"},{"type":"image","path":"/samchenliveson.org/images/IMG_2709.jpeg","thumbnailSrc":"/thumbnails//samchenliveson.org/images/IMG_2709.jpeg"},{"type":"image","path":"/samchenliveson.org/images/IMG_6473.jpeg","thumbnailSrc":"/thumbnails//samchenliveson.org/images/IMG_6473.jpeg"}]}]}]]
