        "Two weeks ago, I saw Samuel. I held his hand—it was always warm and slightly sweaty. I asked him, “Why are your fingers bent like this?” Samuel didn’t know how to answer; he just smiled.",
        "Looking at his picture now, he feels so real. I can still hear his voice in my ears:",
        "\"You wanna dance with me?\"",
        "\"You want to play my favorite song?\"",
        "Today, as we bid Samuel farewell on his final journey, I know that in heaven, he must be joyfully rejoicing because his beloved parents, family, and friends have all come to see him off.",
        "Samuel has always been the one closest to heaven. His love, kindness, and joy came entirely from God.",
        "We will meet again in heaven, and I know this is not just an empty phrase, but God’s true promise—he is already in that better place.",
        "I am grateful that Samuel touched my soul. I am grateful to God, who is real and living.",
        "\"Truly I tell you, anyone who will not receive the kingdom of God like a little child will never enter it.\" (Mark 10:15)",
        "From now on, whenever I read this verse, I will always remember Samuel."
