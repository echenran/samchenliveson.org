        "Sister Yanfei,",
        "From the first time I met you three months ago, I could feel your resilience and inner strength. Today, after attending Angel Samuel’s farewell, I have come to understand even more deeply where that strength comes from.",
        "Perhaps because I have personally battled cancer and congenital heart disease, I have a profound understanding of life’s fragility and have contemplated the boundaries between life and death countless times. In this journey, I have given birth to four children, which has helped me comprehend even more deeply the inseparable bond between a mother and her child.",
        "I can feel that over the nearly 7,000 days, from the moment Samuel was in your womb, the depth and length of your companionship far exceeded that of most people—it was an incredibly precious journey.",
        "I have always believed that separation is not the end of fate, but the beginning of another journey. Samuel has a new mission to fulfill, while you are still here, carrying on with this love. Though pain is inevitable, love will always remain, and you will never be alone.",
        "I am grateful to have met you—you have been a guiding light in my life."
