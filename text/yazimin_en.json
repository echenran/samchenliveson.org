        "The first time I met Samuel was when I volunteered for Wendy Li’s team. At first, I was afraid of him because he was different. I feared he might hurt me. But why did I think this way?",
        "I reflected on it and realized that my mother had instilled in me the idea that encountering people who are different from us means potential harm. Now, I understand that this mindset was wrong.",
        "I feel deep guilt for my initial fear of Samuel. No one knew about it, but I did. And that fear, I now realize, was a form of discrimination—it could have hurt his soul, and it tormented my conscience.",
        "Later, I met Samuel again in our Bible study group, and for the first time, I got to truly know him. Some of his actions might seem unusual to most—such as asking for a hug upon first meeting or wanting to dance together. But in reality, those actions came from his love for this world and his love for everyone around him. He simply wanted to do joyful things with others.",
        "Samuel’s world was small—it revolved around praising people, calling every sister beautiful, and requesting his favorite songs to be played.",
        "He would compliment us so seriously: “Your outfit looks great,” or “Sister, you’re beautiful.” Every woman he met was his “favorite girl,” his “best girl.” We used to tease him about it, but he didn’t mind. He would move on, sit quietly for a moment, and then find happiness again.",
        "Perhaps, in his eyes, our world was dull. There was no music, no dancing—just a bunch of people talking about things he didn’t understand.",
        "During the holidays, he was once corrected for calling women “Auntie” and was told to say “Sister” instead. He remembered it well, and from then on, no matter the person’s age, he always called them \"Sister.\"",
        "Last week at our gathering, the first thing Samuel did was tell me, “You are the best sister,” before offering words of praise to everyone around him.",
        "When we sang together, he would clap excitedly. Uncle Chen would try to stop him, fearing that he was disturbing others. But I understood—Samuel’s world didn’t have the concept of \"disturbing.\" He just wanted to express his happiness and love—he wanted the whole world to know.",
        "Last week, when we were singing, he even grabbed my hand with his small, firm fingers and tapped along to the rhythm on the table. After we finished, Uncle Chen gently held Samuel’s hand and said, \"Samuel, look, your fingers are different from ours.\"",
        "Every week, after Bible study, it would be late at night. Samuel would always ask if I needed a ride home and would check with Auntie Yanfei and Uncle Chen if they could drive me.",
        "At that time, I wasn’t close with everyone yet—but Samuel wanted to make sure I got home safely.",
        "He would look forward to me playing his favorite song in the car. But during Bible study, we couldn’t play music. The ride home was short, and I never got the chance to play his song.",
        "Once, I didn’t even understand the name of the song he wanted. He invited me to go out and eat hotpot together, but I shyly declined, thinking we had plenty of time and more chances to do things together in the future.",
        "I never thought that the person I saw just last week would never be seen again.",
        "If I had known, I would have said yes. I would have played his favorite song. I would have spent more time with him.",
        "Samuel tried to help everyone understand him with his kindness and love, and he truly loved this world. He wanted to embrace everyone.",
        "Samuel protected me. On those cold and dark nights, I didn’t have to walk home alone in the wind. I could sit in a warm car, talking and laughing on the way home.",
        "He once said, “I love Sister. Daddy loves Mommy. Should we switch?” I understood what he meant—he wanted Uncle Chen and Auntie Yanfei to love me too. Samuel was so clever—he knew that if we switched, everyone would love me too. He wanted me to receive love as well.",
        "Samuel was the kindest and purest person I have ever met. He walked through this chaotic world, yet not a speck of dust clung to him.",
        "Surely, he must have encountered inexplicable cruelty at some point. But even so, he still wanted to hug people, to hold hands, to sing and dance with everyone.",
        "He was like a person who had never eaten from the Tree of Knowledge—untainted, returning to innocence, loving the world with the purest, most passionate heart. He generously used his love to nourish the souls of those who were barren."
