        "Yesterday, when I suddenly heard this news, I could hardly believe it was real. I was deeply shocked—Samuel’s smile and voice are still so vivid in my mind.",
        "Once, at a small group gathering, we washed some green grapes. He offered me some to eat. After the gathering, he said, \"Don't be afraid of the dark,\" and made sure I was safely accompanied home, even asking Lawyer Chen and Lawyer Ran to walk me home. I was so touched.",
        "Samuel was pure, innocent, warm-hearted, kind, and untainted by the world. He especially loved singing hymns and worshiping God. Now, Samuel has found rest in the Lord’s embrace.",
        "May Samuel’s family find peace in this difficult time. May little angel Samuel Chen rest in the Lord’s presence, in eternal peace.",
        "Revelation 21:4 - \"He will wipe every tear from their eyes. There will be no more death or mourning or crying or pain.\" Amen!"
