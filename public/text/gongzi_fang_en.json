        "Angel Samuel mended the world with love. His life, though brief, bloomed in love. His journey has not ended—it has only found rest in God’s embrace. His love will not fade away but will shine like a light, illuminating all of us who were once warmed by him.",
        "You are not alone—Samuel is with you in heaven, and we are here with you on earth.",
        "May Samuel rest in peace, and may his love continue to inspire and bless everyone he touched."
