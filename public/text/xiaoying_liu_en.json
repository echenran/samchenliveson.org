        "Samuel was truly an angel—always cheerful and passionate, always speaking sweet words of praise. His words still echo and encourage me: \"Xiaoying is the best! God bless you!\"",
        "It has been a week since he left, and every time I think of him, I cannot help but tear up. It is heartbreaking to part with him. I do not understand God’s purpose—why did He suddenly call this angel back to heaven? Does He have an important mission for him?",
        "Samuel often said, \"Xiaoying, come to my house for dinner!\" or \"Xiaoying, I want to ride in your car and go out for fun...\"",
        "Thank God! Thank God for arranging that, six days before Samuel left, we had the chance to fulfill his wish. That day, I had hot pot with him, sitting beside him, picking out his favorite meatballs and peeling lobster for him. After dinner, I drove him to a performance, and he sat beside me, very happy. Thank God that we had this chance before he left; otherwise, I would have felt an overwhelming sense of guilt now.",
        "But I didn’t know that day was our farewell. During the show, I reminded him several times not to clap too loudly. But he was always so obedient—he immediately quieted his claps and leaned over to say, \"Xiaoying, look, I’m being good, right?\"",
        "If I had known it was our farewell, I would not have reminded him—I would have let him clap as loudly as he wanted!",
        "Thinking about this, I can’t stop my tears from flowing. I don’t want to accept his departure. But I know I must not cry—this is a test.",
        "God is so good! We must believe that Samuel’s departure means he has completed his mission on earth and has returned home in glory."
