        "My wife and I have known about Samuel’s family's touching story since we first came to church six years ago. Watching \"Thank You, My Dear Baby\" moved us to tears—it truly taught us how to be good parents and how to face life’s toughest challenges.",
        "Samuel, our little brother in Christ, we will never forget you. Six years ago, in the church lobby, you helped my two-year-old daughter, Christina, when she was knocked over. You comforted her, saying, “Don’t cry,” and gave her a kiss. And just like that, she stopped crying.",
        "Samuel, you came into this world by God’s will, to show us what true love looks like—the love that is needed in heaven.",
        "We are so grateful to have met you. We will always miss you. Until we meet again in heaven!"
